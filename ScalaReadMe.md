Scala Topics 
-------------------
What is Scala programming?
-
- Scala is a high-level programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It was designed to be concise, scalable, and type-safe. 

New features added in Scala 3 from Scala 2
----------------------------------------------------

>> **Enums**: Scala 3 supports enums, making it easier to define algebraic data types more concisely.

>> **Contextual Abstractions**: Scala 3 replaces the implicit keyword with more explicit keywords like given, using, and extension, making the intent clearer and reducing confusion.

>> **Metaprogramming**:  Scala 3 introduces a new metaprogramming model that uses TASTy (Typed Abstract Syntax Trees) reflect and macros, offering more powerful and safer ways to perform compile-time operations and code generation.

>> **Compiler Improvements**: The Scala 3 compiler, known as Dotty, has been completely rewritten. This new compiler is designed to be more robust, with better error messages and improved performance. 

>> **Scala 2 and Scala 3 Interoperability**: Projects can mix Scala 2.13 and Scala 3 code, allowing a gradual migration.
